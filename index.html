            <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>Throughout this course, I’ve learned that I’m passionate about technology and helping people through innovative solutions. I’ve realized I enjoy problem-solving, coding, and working on projects that have real-world applications. Possible career paths that interest me include software development, UI/UX design, and project management.</p>

            <h3>Self-Awareness & Professionalism</h3>
            <p>I’ve developed strong professional skills such as writing professional emails, presenting ideas clearly, and maintaining a professional online presence. These skills are crucial for networking and making a great first impression in the tech industry.</p>

            <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
            <p>To grow as a professional, I plan to strengthen my Spartan Ready® Competencies by taking on leadership roles in group projects, improving my technical skills through internships, and continuing to refine my communication skills by attending workshops and seminars.</p>

            <h3>Professionalism & Life Skills</h3>
            <p>In my Quinncia Mock Interview, I received feedback on my ability to clearly articulate my skills, but I need to work on providing more concise examples. My resume review highlighted the need to quantify my achievements. My action steps include practicing STAR-format answers for interviews and updating my resume regularly.</p>

            <h3>Walk-Up Song</h3>
            <p>My walk-up song would be <em>Eye of the Tiger</em> by Survivor because it inspires confidence and determination.</p>
