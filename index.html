            <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>What have you learned about yourself and possible career paths that interest you?</strong>
                    <p>
                        I’ve learned that I am deeply passionate about problem-solving and building innovative solutions. Career paths like software development, hardware engineering, and artificial intelligence strongly align with my interests and skills.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What specific professional skills have you acquired throughout the course? Why are these important for you?</strong>
                    <p>
                        I’ve acquired skills like communication, critical thinking, and teamwork, as well as technical skills in programming and project management. These are essential for effectively contributing to professional teams and tackling complex challenges.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How do you plan to develop your Spartan Ready® Competencies to grow as a professional after graduation?</strong>
                    <p>
                        I plan to participate in internships, work on personal projects, and take advantage of mentorship opportunities to continuously develop skills like leadership, professionalism, and adaptability.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What feedback did you receive from the Quinncia Mock Interview and resume review? What did you do well, and what can you improve?</strong>
                    <p>
                        The feedback highlighted my clear and concise answers, as well as my ability to showcase technical projects. However, I need to work on tailoring my responses more specifically to the roles I’m applying for.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>If you were walking into an interview, what song would you have playing to announce your arrival?</strong>
                    <p>
                        My walk-up song would be <em>“It's good to be king”</em> by Tom Petty.
